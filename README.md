Hi, I’m Anshul Patil, a B.Tech student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Surat. I work on AI and RAG-based systems combining FastAPI, React, and LLMs. My recent projects include Agentic PR Copilot and Titan-Guidance, focusing on scalable AI pipelines, efficient backends, and end-to-end automation.
